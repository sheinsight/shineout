| data | any[] | [] | data. The child node is children. If the children value is null or its length is 0, it is render as a leaf node. |
| value | string \| string[] | | In the Form, the value will be taken over by the form and the value will be invalid. |
| defaultValue | string \| string[] | | Initial value |
| defaultExpanded | string[] | - | Default expanded node key. |
| disabled | (data: object) => boolean \| boolean | false | When it is true, all nodes disable the selection; when it is a function, it determines whether it is disabled according to the return result of the function. |
| filterDelay | number | 400 | ms. The delay of user input triggering filter events |
| name | string | - | The name of a Form that accesses data |
| keygen | ((data: object) => string) \| string \| true | index | Generate a auxiliary method for each key<br />If not filled, index will be used(not recommended,there may be problems with more than 10 data)<br />When it is a function, use its return value.<br />When it is a string，ues the value of the string.For example, 'id' is the same thing as (d) => d.id. |
